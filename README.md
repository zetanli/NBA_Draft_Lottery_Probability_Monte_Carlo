# NBA_Draft_Lottery_Probability_Monte_Carlo

Assume that the NBA lottery odds and structure are further modified as follows:
i. Rather than deciding the top three (old system) or four (new system) picks by the lottery, the top five picks are decided by the lottery
ii. The lottery is expanded from 14 teams to 16 teams (in addition to the 14 non-playoff teams, the lottery now includes 2 playoff teams)
